# Titanic Survival Prediction
## Kaggle titanic competition - who survives?

This is my notebook on the Kaggle titanic competition that I have put together while learning how to use scikit-learn, pandas, and seaborn. It contains a walkthrough of the whole project, starting with EDA, and data processing, going on to basic feature engineering, model selection and validation (random forest, logistic regression, support vector classifier, and knn), and predictions for the test set. I also go through some classification metrics, and try to answer the question "Who were the luckiest survivors?"
